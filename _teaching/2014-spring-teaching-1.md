For two years, I volunteered as a Balvikas teacher at the Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organization, Thapathali Centre, Kathmandu.

My responsibilities included:
- Preparing simple value-based lessons and activities for children.
- Leading weekly classes and engaging students through stories and discussions.
- Coordinating with other volunteers to plan sessions and events.
