## A Drop's Journey 

“How hard was it for him to defy gravity? I would have easily released him to the atmosphere if he had come to me. poor dew,”. A large, tall tree said. "Have you ever recalled how hard it is for you to pull such a tiny drop of water?", Short grass retorted.

It's a crisp, serene winter morning, the sun is shining its golden beams on the earth, and somewhere you can hear the clamour of various animals and birds. On a leaf of short grass, a single little droplet appears poised to fall off the edge. From underneath, the drop is awaiting that microscopic pressure.

When it rains the soil absorbs the water , depending upon the type of soil, water is classified into different categories. It sounds interesting, we are the same but different. Some of us dive deep into the earth's surface and they call us gravitational water. Others cling tightly to soil particles, becoming hygroscopic and hence they are named as hygroscopic water. Some run off quickly, runaway waters, rushing to rivers, not even pausing to say hello.Few are hidden deep inside, chemically combined, locked away until the soil calls them forth.Then there are my capillary cousins,dancing in narrow spaces between soil particles oved most by roots, feeding life drop by drop.

Regardless of the names given to my fellows, we all share the same objective ,to reach the ocean. Even though the path may differ, the destination is same. Indeed, I am the same drop of dew that they are talking about which is going to fall from the short grass.

From the edge of bonds, I feel myself falling,

As the sun on the horizon begins its calling.

Gone are the days of shadow and strain,

Now golden light breaks through the pain.

Deep within me, I sensed the sun's warmth. Whoa, I'm glowing like gold. I had never been this beautiful in my cycle around the sky and the ground. As soon as I realised how beautiful I was, I turned into a vapour and those guys continued to fight among themselves.

The tree looked down at the grass with a slow, knowing smile. “You really love to drip, don’t you? Guttation every morning, wasting water like it’s nothing.” Grass laughed softly. “Oh, come on. At least I don’t just sweat it all away like you do with transpiration. You lose way more water than you keep.” The tree’s branches creaked gently. “Sure, but that ‘sweating’ cools the world and keeps the air fresh. You’re just leaking because your roots can’t keep up when the soil’s soaked.” Grass flicked her blades proudly. “Better to let go than drown, right? And besides, you know your transpiration’s part of the same story. Different moves, same dance.” The tree nodded, amused. “Alright, maybe you’ve got a point. Different roots, different styles, same goal: stay alive.” They both fell silent, warmed by the rising sun, watching the dew vanish and the world wake up.

From deep roots to surface blades

From towering trunks to tender blades

Each drinks in its own quiet way

But all are bound by water’s way.

Every day, the sun gently warms water from rivers, streams, lakes, oceans—and even from the tiniest droplet resting on a leaf. As the heat rises, we droplets feel a surge of energy, and many of us transform into invisible vapor. This process is called evaporation, and it’s happening all the time. Each year, about 577,000 cubic kilometers of water evaporate from the Earth’s surface, with the vast oceans being the greatest contributors. But not all of us rise from open waters. Some take the quieter path like the water drawn up by trees and released through their leaves into the air. This is transpiration, and it adds nearly 10% of the water found in the atmosphere. And then there’s guttation, my gentle cousin, when grass and small plants push droplets from their leaf tips through a small pore called hydathodes during cool, humid mornings especially when the soil is heavy with moisture. Whether we rise as vapor from oceans, escape through leaves, or hang trembling on a blade of grass we are all part of the same endless cycle.

Of all the forms that I became,

This one I scarcely thought to claim.

Bathed in gold and warm embrace,

I rose then vanished without a trace.

As I drifted higher, carried by gentle winds, I marveled at the patchwork of Earth below me.I wasn’t alone. Around me, millions of other droplets rose together, invisible but full of energy. We twirled and danced in the sunlight, lifted by warmth and breeze, moving toward the sky.

Up here, the air grew cooler, and something magical happened. We began to come together, tiny droplets gathering to form clouds soft, billowy giants drifting across the heavens. I marveled at the sight: endless skies filled with our shimmering forms, glistening in the sunlight.

Being part of a cloud felt like belonging to a great family. We floated over mountains, valleys, and oceans, connected by invisible threads of vapor and wind. The world below looked vast and beautiful. I imagined the adventures awaiting me: falling as rain to quench thirsty earth, flowing in rivers, nourishing forests, and replenishing lakes.

As I floated within the cool embrace of the cloud, the air around me grew colder and heavier. I felt myself and my fellow droplets drawing closer, like old friends gathering for a gentle reunion. One by one, we joined together, becoming bigger and heavier, bound by invisible threads of water and warmth.

The sky, once our playground, now gently urged us downward. Gravity’s quiet pull grew stronger and stronger with every passing day. Sometimes, when the air was cold enough, I transformed into a delicate snowflake, drifting softly through the sky. Other times, I morphed to raindrops, sleet, or hail, each shape a different story, and with each fall a new beginning.

This beautiful journey from cloud to earth is called precipitation the sky’s way of gifting water back to the land, to rivers, forests, and oceans. It is the moment when the sky and earth reconnect, and I, a tiny droplet, become part of something much bigger than myself.

I fall as snow, soft and slow,

I crash as hail with sudden blow.

I drift as rain from cloud to clay,

Then vanish as mist fades away.

In the sky , The first lands I saw were wild and green dense forests stretching as far as my eyes could reach. Rivers snaked through the trees, their waters clear and shining under the sun like ribbons of glass. Birds soared alongside me, and fish darted beneath the water’s surface. Here, the water was alive, pure, a source of endless life.

But then, as the cloud drifted over lands shaped by human hands, the joy began to fade.

Soon, I passed over lands scarred by human hands. Rivers that once sparkled were now dark and sluggish. Factories with tall chimneys puffed thick clouds of smoke, and their shadows fell on us heavy with oily film and floating trash. The air smelled sharp and strange.

I hovered over sprawling cities, where concrete and steel had replaced soil and trees. Water ran in narrow, polluted channels, carrying away garbage and chemicals. The rain gutters brimmed with waste, and the once vibrant streams choked beneath the weight of plastic bottles, wrappers, and abandoned nets.

Fields of crops stretched endlessly, but their soil was exhausted. fertilizers and pesticides turned waterways murky and sickly green. In some places, the water was so full of poison that life under water floated lifeless on the surface.

Up here, in the sky, things were not better. Some of the vapors my fellow droplets whispered of the strange new clouds forming. Darker, heavier clouds tinged with a bitter smell acid clouds, formed from the pollution of smoke and chemicals.

“We carry poison now,” one cloud murmured, “and when we fall, the earth will feel our burden and we will destroy the very life.”

I shivered, wondering how I could be part of something so beautiful and yet so broken and disturbed, something that supports life and destroys also.

But the cycle continued and it will continue but this time with a hope. A hope that will create a spark among mankind to acknowledge the value of us.

We shine like crystals; they call us dew,

The source of all life — yet still they misuse.

What will remain if we vanish or die?

Preserve us well, or life won’t survive.

I have traveled far and wide, carried by the warm breath of the sun and the soft touch of the wind. The water is the lifeblood of the planet, cycling endlessly to nurture forests, fill rivers, and sustain every living creature. Yet, beneath this beautiful dance lies a quiet struggle.

Though freshwater makes up only about 2.5% of all water, less than 1% is easily accessible for drinking, farming, and life’s needs. Sadly, nearly 80% of the wastewater produced by humans returns to nature without proper treatment, bringing with it chemicals and wastes that cloud rivers and lakes, dimming their sparkle and making them harder to call home.

Every day, nearly 2 million tons of sewage, industrial, and agricultural waste pour into rivers, lakes, and oceans around the world. This unseen burden clouds the waters I cherish and weakens the delicate balance of life within. These pollutants bring sickness to many, not only to the creatures that swim and grow in the water but also to the people who depend on it for life’s simplest needs.

Above, factories release millions of tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the sky. These mingle with clouds like mine, creating acid rain that softly falls but can turn waters too sour for many fish and plants. The delicate balance of lakes and streams is disturbed, and many aquatic lives struggle to survive.

Far out in the oceans, over 50% of coral reefs have been lost in the past thirty years, their vibrant colors fading as warming waters and pollution take their toll. Fish populations, especially the large predators, have declined by more than 90%, and coastal waters bear “dead zones” where oxygen is too low to sustain life.

It is a heavy story to carry, but I hold onto hope. For even a single drop can remind those who listen that water is life, delicate and precious. If we cherish it, if we protect it, this endless cycle of renewal can continue, and the Earth can heal.

The wind pushed us onward, and soon I felt myself growing heavier. The cloud was ready to release us once more.

As I fell from the sky, rain again, I saw the world from a new angle some places still untouched, some still healing, some crying out for help.

My journey was far from over.

You may not see me next, but I’m always there rising, falling, giving life, carrying hope
