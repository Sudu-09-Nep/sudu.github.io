In 2025, I completed a 10-day hands-on training program on cell engineering organized by the Foundation for Advancement of Biosciences and Applications (FABA) in association with Thermo Fisher Scientific. The workshop covered a full experimental workflow with mammalian cell lines, from media preparation to genome editing and analysis.

Key activities included:
- Preparing complete culture media and practicing aseptic technique.
- Performing cell viability assays and cell counting for seeding optimization.
- Reviving, passaging, cryopreserving, and thawing adherent cell lines.
- Designing and executing drug treatment experiments.
- Using Lipofectamine 3000 for GFP overexpression in HEK-293 cells.
- Applying Neon NXT electroporation and CRISPR-Cas9 RNP delivery in HEK-293 and Jurkat cells.
- Running PCR to assess editing outcomes and compiling a final report based on the experimental data.

This training strengthened my foundation in experimental cell biology and complements my interests in genomics and bioinformatics.
Extended notes and day-by-day details are documented in my privtate lab notebook, selected sections are available on request.
