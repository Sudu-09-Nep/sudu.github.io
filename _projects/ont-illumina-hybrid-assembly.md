This project follows a hybrid Nanopore–Illumina assembly tutorial to build a reproducible workflow for assembling a bacterial genome from long-read and short-read data.

- Set up a conda environment from `environment.yml` for all required tools.
- Organized reads, intermediate results, and scripts in a clear directory structure.
- Practiced running and interpreting hybrid assemblies and polishing steps.
