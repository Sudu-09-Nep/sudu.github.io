Although I’m still an undergraduate, I enjoy sharing what I’m learning and helping peers understand difficult topics.

So far, my teaching and mentoring experience includes:
- Voluntary teaching of Balvikas students for two years at the Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organization, Thapathali centre, Kathmandu.
- Informally explaining genomics and bioinformatics concepts to classmates.
- Helping friends set up basic command-line and Git workflows on macOS.
- Discussing ideas in cell biology, microbiology, and molecular biology practicals.
