Hi, I’m **Sudarshan Aryal**. And Welcome to this Organized Chaos.

This site is my collection of ideas, projects, learning notes, and stories that got tired living in my notebook. I use this space to share what I’m learning, the projects I’m working on, and thoughts that usually arrive during lonely walks or late-night overthinking.

you’ll find reflections on nature, life, or things that don’t have clear answers yet.

So Enjoy my ideas that are still stretching their legs, feel free to explore. Take what’s useful, ignore what’s not, and come back anytime.
