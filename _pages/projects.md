Here are some of the projects and workflows I’m exploring as an undergraduate bioscience and biotechnology student.

- Genome assembly and polishing with tools like Medaka, Polypolish, and related pipelines.
- Species identification and bacterial genomics using hybrid Illumina/ONT data.
- Workflow automation and reproducible analysis with Snakemake and Nextflow.
